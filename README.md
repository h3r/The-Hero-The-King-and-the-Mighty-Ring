The Hero, The King & The Mighty Ring
====================================

This is a simple finite state machine to represent a simple quest game where the hero has to find the king's lost ring and return to him to receibe the reward.

The following diagram represents how complex this may become even for a simple quest like this. (ok i added some unnecesary fluff :'D)

This FSM was implemented using a simple JavaScript class "State" with conditional options that deppend of the game state. You may play a web version of the FSM in a  [[**online demo**]](https://h3r.github.io/The-Hero-The-King-and-the-Mighty-Ring/).
