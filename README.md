The Hero, The King & The Mighty Ring
====================================

This is a simple self-exercise to create a simple game using the most simple finite state machine. The game consists of a hero that receives the quest from the king to find his precious lost ring and return to him to complete the quest and receive the reward.

The game is implemented using plain simple JavaScript, implemmenting a "State" "class" with conditional options that deppending of the game state drives you to one state or other. Whenever you switch between states the gui is refreshed and pressents you the new state with the new possible options (depending on current state). You may find the whole development in the [[ game.js ]](https://github.com/h3r/The-Hero-The-King-and-the-Mighty-Ring/blob/master/js/game.js) file.

You may play a web version of the mini-game in the online [[  demo ]](https://h3r.github.io/The-Hero-The-King-and-the-Mighty-Ring/).


The following diagram represents how complex this may become even for a simple quest like this. (ok i added some unnecesary fluff :'D)
